Back in January, if someone would have told me that I would be a stay-at-home, homeschooling, full-stack web dev student at Flatiron , I would have laughed at them and said your nuts!….Yet somehow that is exactly where 2020 has led me…...

But my very situation is what inspired my project. It is a homework/homeschool tracker, where my husband and I would be able to add/update assignments, according to the child and subject. We are  able to leave comments regarding one of the children and the particular assignment assigned to them. And once the assignment is complete we can mark it as complete.

The   project I turned in, I can honestly say, it is not my best as far as presentation goes, however, it is definitely a testament to just how driven I am to get through this journey!  I wrestled and struggled and even cried over this project, dots were not connecting over the join tables and how the project needed to be built around it. For some reason, my brain was not allowing me to fully see/process how to utilize the join table in order to have a functional code! The dots didn't really start to connect for the project until Saturday(last night) around 2am. The amount of hours I spent working tirelessly was insane, and the amount of code I had to show for it, was also insane{not the good insane lol}. 

I can say, I better understand the purpose of a join table and how it allows the children and subjects to interact around one another, allowing for children and subjects to have assignments. I definitely learned a great deal from this portion of my coding journey!  And the areas that seemed to have been confusing I certainly gained some clarity and am continuing to gain understanding.

As I mentioned before, if nothing else, I am proud of the amount of growth and perseverance I had pushing through this project.
