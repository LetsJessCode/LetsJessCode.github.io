Before I made this change I lived in Mount Juliet, TN, while there I worked for a company named Kepro. Kepro was contracted through the State of Tennessee. We were in charge of processing and maintaining Medicaid applications for our Tennessee residents.  I joined the company in September of 2019 as a CSR agent. I was quickly promoted in November to be part of the Training Department. During that time I aided in preparing coursework, developing training materials and even implemented new training for our new hires as well as tenured agents.  It was a very fulfilling job!

I worked hard{harder than most} and often times it went unnoticed....it didnt bother me though, because the work I did MATTERED, I was building our Agent's confidence, which in turn positioned them to aid/assist our Tenneseans with their Medicaid. From a financial standpoint, the money I brought in, supplemented what my husband made, so our family was financially comfortable :)

**March 02** My husband and I were putting the last of my son's bithday plans together that evening, he was turning 6 (on March 06)! 

We were all looking forward to that day! It was super exciting it was his "GOLDEN BIRTHDAY!" We fell asleep that night, and around 12:30am we were woken up by our phone alarms.....shortly after we hear tornado sirens! We immediately jumped out of our bed, grabbed our kids and hid in a closet until everything passed. That morning, we learned our city as well as downtown Nashville were destroyed, a few schools in our children's districts were so badly damaged that their schools were shut down for the remainder of the year. But it was okay, our county came together and found a way to merge those students into the schools that didn't suffer any damage. 

But then a couple weeks later, the quarantine took place, and {like many others} our lives slowly started to shift out of balance. I was deemed an essential worker, my husband was no longer working, our children were all home from school(we have 4), and I was slowly beginning to crumble under the pressure!

You see, I went from working because I love it, to working because I HAD TO, and the amount of money I was making, was not nearly enough to feed a family of 6 and maintain our living expenses. The stipened helped a great deal, but it wasn't enough to keep our family from financially drowning. 

**** May 02 ****

My mother in law had been talking to me about this AMAZING PROGRAM! You go to school for 5 months and you come out making almost 6 figures!!! I was honestly not buying into that...it sounded like a "get rich quick" scheme. She just kept insisting that I speak with Kesha(Flatiron graduate) so I decided to reach out to her. Kesha painted a slightly different(more realistic) picture!  She challenged me to try some prep course work, to see if I would understand it. so I did. This ultimately led to me applying for, and being accepted into FlatIron School for Software Engineering...

The logic behind my decision to leave the job I had to enter a different field of profession, was simple for me! 

Given the chaotic months my family faced, I wanted to position myself to be more than a supplement to my family and my husband. I need to be the support our family needs, the next time life throws us a curve ball. I don't ever want my husband to feel the burden or pressure of letting his family down {financially} because of matters outside of his control! He has been our sole rock and support for 10 years following his dreams of being a self-employed musician! This quarantine really knocked us back but it didn't knock us down! 

 **So in a nutshell, I chose Software Engineering, to arm myself with a skillset that I can put to use, to set my family up for success and to allow my husband to continue to follow his dreams! My family was always my dream! Having a husband that loves me and children of my own to raise....that was my dream! So I get to live my dream daily!! By joining this new career path, I am able to take care of and maintain my dream! **
