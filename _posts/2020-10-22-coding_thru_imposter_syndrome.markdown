Wow! It's been a roller coaster of emotions! I never realized how suffocating imposter syndrome could be until I started my Flatiron Journey! I really truly wish I could say confidently that I kicked Coding's Butt and Imposter Syndrome is no longer a crippling situation, BUT I would be 100% lying if I did! As a matter of fact, it seems as though imposter syndrome kicked into high gear right at the moment it was time to submit my last project and schedule my final assessment. I look back over my entire journey and I keep asking myself, "When did I get to this point? How did I make it this far? And where did the time go?" 

I guess for my final Blog I just want to tell you to just breathe, we made it this far, we got thru it, right?

The biggest lesson I've learned that I'd like to share is to take stock in yourself. Look at all the things that we are able to do now, things that we were unable to do just 5 months prior!!! 

We have built 5 projects, wrote blogs on our experiences, networked and grew as individuals! I'm unsure what led each of you to this coding journey, but you are here, and we made it!!!

Let's all give ourselves a pat on the back! This was far from easy, yet somehow, we are here! Reflecting on the fact that just 5 months ago I had no idea about any type of coding languages...I thought Java was coffee and Ruby was a birthstone (no but seriously that is what I thought) Now I am developing websites and learning to speak in these foreign languages. ðŸ™‚

This is the first chapter to a new story line in my life. I started out with this journey with the intent to maintain my dream and I can happily say that I am officially one step closer to achieving that goal! Keep pushing, keep coding, keep asking questions! 

And I wish each and everyone of you the best of luck as you embark on the next phase of your coding Career!!!

Congrats to all the new Flatiron Alum!!!
