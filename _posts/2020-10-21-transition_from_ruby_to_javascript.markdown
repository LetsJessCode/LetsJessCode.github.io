I learned a lot about my learning style and language preference throughout this project...

It is so amazing just how versatile JavaScript can be! Coming into this journey knowing absolutely nothing about coding, and now learning how to build web applications has been a very challenging task. One thing I have had to learn is to focus on my own personal progress and not compare myself to those who are seemingly more advanced than I am! For the project examples I saw some pretty impressive and complex JS Projects, and it was beyond intimidating, however, for myself I wanted to make sure that I was able to understand my project more so than anything else. So I wanted to focus on something that I enjoyed while learning the ins and outs of how putting a front and back end application together.

The biggest challenge for me dealing with JavaScript is that it is so Vanilla, and there are soooo many ways to approach a situation that I found myself receiving different answers to the same question! That was  my biggest obstacle, because most times I felt myself more confused than before. I finally had to take a step back and find what worked best for me. For example: I found myself battling with how I wanted to code out my HTML format: did I want to create each div and essentially build it out line by line, or did I want to just create the div, grab it throw some html code inside some `` and just .innerHTML that bad boy. Both work well, but I learned that, when it came to my project, they both had a moment where one just made more sense than the other. 

For my project I decided to create a Soap Maker Application. My API contains 2 classes a soap and base class...the soap belongs to a base and base has many soaps. The attributes of Soap include, color, exfoliants, butters, oils and choosing a name for the soap. I decided to use the active model serializer, it better assisted with the associations and converting my api into a json readable format. Which honestly made it easier to access the nested objects when it came time to do display the created soaps. 

This was a very different project for me, as I was struggling with the mental transition from Ruby to JavaScript, I do believe wrestling with this project allowed me a better insight into how JavaScript functions and it was my first look into what it is like to create both a front and back end as well. That being said...

I am very excited to transition into React/Redux to see how the principles I learned in JavaScript will tie into what I am learning in React!
