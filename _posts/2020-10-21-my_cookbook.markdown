I come from a very large family. I hold on to many great memories that were created with them, more specifically memories made during the holidays. The whole family would come together, creating what seemed to be magical experiences. My favorite memories of those past times, are centered around my grandmother and her infamous family cookbook of secret recipes for the holidays. Affectionately known as Big Mama", my grandmother had a box of recipes that were only used on special occasions every year. Some of the most memorable moments spent with her were when she would get all of her granddaughters together to choose the meals and desserts to be made for our entire family.Â After she passed in 2015, I was blessed with all of her recipes! I would love to be able to pass them down along with an addition of my own original recipes to my children. This inspired me to create a website capable of storing recipes, a virtual cookbook.

Beginning the creation of my application, I first started with the User creating a profile. The user first enters their name, then continues to create a username and password. The program then forms a personal experience through the application, addressing them by name.

Next was to create an application that would offer the individual the ability to add their first recipe to their virtual cookbook. Placeholders were used within the code to serve as brief examples for the user to navigate with ease when filling out recipes.

> <form action="/recipes" method="post">
<input type="text" name="recipe[name]" placeholder="Ex. Grilled-Cheese" id="name"><br>
<input type="text" name="recipe[meal_type]" placeholder="Lunch" id="meal_type"><br>

 After a recipe is created, it is then stored in the users profile. They are then able to view and edit all recipes. Given the ability to give the recipe a name, the type of meal, how many servings the recipe will yield, the prep time, cook time, ingredients and lastly the instructions, the user has a complete database of what is needed to recreate a delicious dish. When the Index page is shown, the user will be able to view the Title of the recipe, as well as the meal type...below is a snippet of what the user would see once a new recipe is added.


I aimed to create an application that I, and many others would benefit from. CRUD played a big role in keeping me on task with making sure the application was both simple, and user-friendly!

I plan to keep building on this idea, adding updates as I continue to progress in my Flatiron journey! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project, and I am looking forward to learning about Rails! Woohoo!!!
