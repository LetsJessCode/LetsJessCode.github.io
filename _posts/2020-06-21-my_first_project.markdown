Okay so first let me preface this blog by saying...."I DID IT!"

I am super proud of myself for accomplishing all that I have so far....I had so many different ideas, and wanted to go in so many different directions(you should see how many ideas I have sitting on my cpu ha ha ha) BUT I finally decided one, I committed to it, and I completed it! 

This project has strethced me so much, and I am really amazed at how much I have grown as a person throughout this experience. I learned so many valuable lessons; the most relevant lesson though, was, "get over yourself and ask for help..."

I have always been a somewhat prideful individual, and determined to figure things out for myself....but this past week has certainly taught me that I do NOT have to figure things out on my own!  I need to use my resources in my software engineering community.

I have a community of peers who have gone through before me, and who are going through with me. They are rooting for me to succeed as much as I am rooting for them. 

I pushed through. I perservered. I created my own CLI. 

LetsJessCode!!!!
